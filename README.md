# AirPup Website

Welcome to AirPup, a simple website for dog lovers to connect and share information about their furry friends. This project utilizes Bootstrap for front-end design, PHP for server-side scripting, and MySQL for database management.
This website was created during the practice session of PHP course.

**If you have PHP installed, you can start the PHP built-in server using**:
php -S localhost:8000

Alternatively, configure your local server environment (such as Apache or Nginx) to serve the project.

**Access the Website**:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or the appropriate URL if you configured a different port).
